# Chat-App
A real-time chat application built using the MERN stack allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, handles user authentication, message storage, and socket connections for real-time communication. MongoDB stores user data and messages, while React creates a dynamic and responsive front-end interface. Using Socket.IO, the application establishes a WebSocket connection, enabling real-time updates between users without needing to refresh the page. This stack ensures scalability, flexibility, and a seamless chat experience across devices.
